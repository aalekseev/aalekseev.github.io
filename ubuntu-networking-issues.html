    <p>A post about issues with network drivers on Ubuntu, that lead to a discovery of lvm partition magic, learning chroot and reasoning about Ubuntu and hardware.</p>
<p>This was one of that day when suddenly things go wild south. It started with a frozen system and fall down all way to missing drivers for network hardware. Debugging problem was hard, with intense use of <code>lshw</code>, <code>lspci</code>, <code>nmcli</code>, <code>ifconfig</code>, grepping through <code>dmesg</code>. Finally, I found out that it was a network driver issue, download it and like in old times <code>make clean modules &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>
<p>Also, it is not obvious but ethernet and wireless networks have different drivers thus it can be easy that only wireless or only ethernet network can be unreachable.</p>
<p>But what really helped me was the ability to connect to broken system from live-cd with working internet connection.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu</span>
<span class="go">sudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/root /mnt/ubuntu</span>

<span class="go">sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/dev</span>
<span class="go">sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/ubuntu/dev/pts</span>
<span class="go">sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/ubuntu/proc</span>
<span class="go">sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/ubuntu/proc</span>

<span class="go">sudo chroot /mnt/ubuntu</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And that's how you can try to fix broken ubuntu system. For example, if you <strong>accidentally</strong> put your system in an infinity booting loop or system won't boot.</p>
<p>In my case, it was that I was not able to install anything without an internet connection. I could download package on the flash drive, put it into working notebook and install with <code>dpkg</code>, but any program packages have dependencies, the more packages you want to install the more dependencies you get. And once apt manager sees unmet dependency it blocks purging, installing etc.</p>
<p>So, while this all was good, and I fixed my network connection, there was still a thought about what if ubuntu brokes again, and I will be downloading, installing and loading live-cd to fix it, maybe I better off installing another Linux distro on the same device.</p>
<p>I must say that modern ubuntu installation is suggesting the use of lvm. It is like a local volume instead of managing real physical volumes. And advantages of this approach is that you can have multiple HDD's but can manage space in them as a whole. But I best like it's <code>disadvantage</code> ðŸ˜ˆ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you broke one local volume, you lost data on all physical volumes that local volume managed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as I understand for today there is not much of a GUI interface for working with lvm. There is a <code>system-config-lvm</code>, a relatively old package, but its disadvantage is that it will not install easily on modern Ubuntu 17+, you have to add package repo to apt and some users on StackOverflow are saying that this GUI program can be a reason for data loss, where console way with <code>lvresize</code> and <code>lvcreate</code> is a safer way.</p>
<p>In order to split lv partition you need to issue only two commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">sudo lvresize -L 800G /dev/ubuntu-vg/root</span>
<span class="go">sudo lvcreate -L 200G -n kali ubuntu-vg</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here <code>ubuntu-vg</code> is local volume group, <code>kali</code> is new local volume partition name, <code>-L</code> stands for limit and sets the new size of the partition.</p>
<p>Also, there is a handy command <code>lvdisplay</code> for getting info about local volumes, they're name and group and <code>lvextend</code> for extending local volume size.</p>
<p>After these manipulations installing secondary os is not a problem. Only remember, if the installer will be complaining about root partition, select desired local volume, hit "change", format to any Ext file format and set the mount point to <code>/</code>.</p>
